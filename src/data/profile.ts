  about:
    "I am a robotics researcher working on how intelligent machines perceive and interact with the physical world. My research focuses on perception-driven manipulation, multimodal sensing, and assistive robotics, with an emphasis on building systems that are reliable, interpretable, and grounded in real-world use. I am particularly interested in building powerful representations from araw sensor data, such that reasoning becomes more effective and intuitive.",
